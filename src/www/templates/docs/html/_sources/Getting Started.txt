Getting Started
****************

==============
Standard Setup
==============

--------------
Clone the repo
--------------

1. Make sure to clone the repo,
   ``git clone https://github.com/abhardwaj/datahub.git``
2. Navigate into the the repo, ``cd datahub``

----------
PostgreSQL
----------

DataHub is built on the `PostgreSQL <http://www.postgresql.org/>`__
database.

1. Install Postgres and create a user called ``postgres``. See
   `here <https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/First_steps>`__ for
   step-by-step instructions.
2. When the Postgres server is running, open the Postgres shell
   ``psql -U postgres``
3. Create a database for DataHub, ``CREATE DATABASE datahub;``
4. Quit the shell with ``\q``

------------------------------
Create ``user_data`` directory
------------------------------

1. Navigate to the root directory, ``cd /``
2. Create the ``user_data`` directory as root user,
   ``sudo mkdir user_data``

We realize that this is not the best location for the ``user_data``
directory. In future commits, we'll make this option configurable and
perhaps default to a different location.

-----------------------
Create a ``virtualenv``
-----------------------

It's useful to install python dependencies in a virtual environment so
they are isolated from other python packages in your system. To do this,
use `virtualenv <http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__.

1. Install virtualenv with pip, ``pip install virtualenv``
2. Create a virtual environment (called ``venv``) within the datahub
   directory, ``virtualenv venv``
3. Activate the virtual environment, ``source venv/bin/activate``.

When you are finished with the virtual environment, run ``deactivate``
to close it.

---------------------------------
Install dependencies with ``pip``
---------------------------------

Installing the dependencies for DataHub is easy using the
`pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`__ package manager.

1. Install the dependencies with ``pip install -r requirements.txt``

----------------------------
Setup server and data models
----------------------------

1. Update ``src/settings.py`` with your postgres username and password.
2. Setup the server environment, ``source src/setup.sh`` (Please note
   that this must be sourced from the root directory.)
3. Sync with the database, ``python src/manage.py migrate``
4. Migrate the data models, ``python src/manage.py migrate inventory``

----------------------------
Install Berkeley DB bindings
----------------------------

1. I haven't written this yet, so for now, please comment out
   ``import bsddb`` from ``src/apps/dbwipes/summary.py``

----------
Run server
----------

1. Run the server, ``python src/manage.py runserver``
2. Navigate to `localhost:8000 <http://localhost:8000>`__

**NOTE:** If the server complains that a module is missing, you may need
to ``source src/setup.sh`` and  ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` again. Then, ``python src/manage.py runserver`` and navigate to
`localhost:8000 <http://localhost:8000>`__

========================================
Vagrant Environment Setup (non-standard)
========================================

1.  You need internet access the first time you do these steps.
2.  Download and install VirtualBox https://www.virtualbox.org/
3.  Download and install Vagrant
    https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
4.  Add this line to your hosts file:
    ``192.168.50.4    datahub-local.mit.edu``
5.  Then start the environment with: ``vagrant up``
6.  Login into vagrant: ``vagrant ssh``
7.  Start the app
    ``cd /vagrant   sudo -s   source src/setup.sh   python src/manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:80``
8.  Then open the browser and go to
    `datahub-local.mit.edu <datahub-local.mit.edu>`__
9.  When you are done
10. Press ``CONTROL-C``
11. Exit the vm with ``exit`` (you need to execute it twice)
12. Shutdown the vm with ``vagrant halt`` (next time you do
    ``vagrant up`` will be much faster as packages are already
    installed; there is no need for internet connection).
13. If you want to delete the vm ``vagrant destroy`` (if you do
    ``vagrant up`` again, it will download and install all the
    packages).

====================
Building Sphinx Docs
====================

`Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org>`__ is included in ``requirements.txt``.

``make html`` rebuilds the documentation.

When submitting a pull request, you must include sphinx documentation. You can achieve this by adding ``*.rst`` and linking them from other ``*.rst`` files. See `the sphinx tutorial <http://sphinx-doc.org/tutorial.html>`__ for more information.
